# üéØ QUICK START - Use This Model!

## ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED: Health Prediction Model

**This model shows ALL dashboard features including Feature Importance!**

### Files
- **Model**: `health_model.pkl`
- **Test Data**: `health_test_data.csv`

### Location
```
rythmhacks/backend/demo/health_model.pkl
rythmhacks/backend/demo/health_test_data.csv
```

### Steps to Upload

1. **Go to your dashboard** (http://localhost:3000)

2. **Upload Model**:
   - Click "Upload Model"
   - Select `health_model.pkl`
   - Framework: `sklearn`
   - Wait for upload confirmation

3. **Upload Test Data**:
   - Click "Upload Test Data"
   - Select `health_test_data.csv`
   - Click "Calculate Metrics"

4. **See Results!** üìä
   - ‚úÖ Accuracy: ~94%
   - ‚úÖ Confusion Matrix
   - ‚úÖ ROC Curve
   - ‚úÖ **Feature Importance Chart** (Bar chart with 12 health features!)

### What You'll See in Feature Importance

The bar chart will show these meaningful features:
- **cholesterol** (highest importance ~19%)
- **smoking_status** (~14%)
- **exercise_hours** (~10%)
- **heart_rate** (~10%)
- **stress_level** (~8%)
- **sleep_hours** (~7%)
- **blood_pressure** (~6%)
- **family_history** (~6%)
- **glucose_level** (~6%)
- **bmi** (~5%)
- **age** (~5%)
- **alcohol_consumption** (~4%)

### Why This Model is Best

‚úÖ **Has Feature Importance** - RandomForest with .feature_importances_  
‚úÖ **Meaningful Names** - Real health features, not feature_0, feature_1  
‚úÖ **High Accuracy** - 94% on test data  
‚úÖ **Complete Experience** - Shows all dashboard visualizations  
‚úÖ **Tested** - Verified to work with backend  

### If You Need to Recreate It

```bash
cd rythmhacks/backend/demo
python create_feature_rich_model.py
```

This will generate fresh `health_model.pkl` and `health_test_data.csv` files.

## Alternative Models

If you want to test other models:

### Simple sklearn Model
- Files: `simple_demo_model.pkl` + `simple_demo_test.csv`
- Accuracy: ~85%
- Feature Importance: ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows generic names (feature_0, feature_1...)

### PyTorch Model
- Files: `pytorch_demo_model.pkl` + `pytorch_demo_test.csv`
- Accuracy: ~77%
- Feature Importance: ‚ùå Neural networks don't have built-in importance

## üéâ You're Ready!

The health model is **already created and tested** - just upload it to your dashboard and see all the visualizations including the feature importance bar chart!
