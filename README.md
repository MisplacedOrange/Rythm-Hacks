## Overview & Core Ideas

- Visualizer for Machine Learning algorithms — a better, more insightful version of Orange Data Mining.
- Fixes what Orange Software lacks:
	- Provide "algorithmic storytelling" visuals: reveal patterns, rhythms, and reasoning behind model behavior.
	- Many visualizers are static; few offer live/streaming updates or interactive parameter control sliders.
- Add real-time simulation of ML behavior as it trains or adapts (live visualization of learning dynamics).
- Collaboration: most tools are single-user. Build multi-user, web-based dashboards for team learning and exploration.
    - Notepad for real-time discussion and observations

## Specific Feature Concepts

### Algorithmic Storytelling Visuals

- Show not just metrics (accuracy/loss) but the *why*:
	- Visual patterns in the data that the model is using.
	- How decision boundaries shift as training proceeds.
	- Representative examples from different regions of the feature space.
- Narrative elements: annotate visuals with short, human-friendly explanations of what the model is "learning" at different stages.

### Real-time Simulation & Parameter Controls

- Live streaming updates of training progress.
- Sliders and interactive controls for hyperparameters (learning rate, regularization, batch size, etc.) with immediate visual feedback.
- Ability to pause, rewind, and inspect intermediate model snapshots.

### Collaboration & Multi-user Dashboards

- Shared dashboards where team members can explore the same experiment together.
- Commenting, annotations, and saved views for knowledge transfer.
- Role-based access: presenters, reviewers, experimenters.

## Comparison / Category Notes (Orange Data Mining)

A concise breakdown of categories, strengths, weaknesses, and UX observations.

| Category | Strength | Weakness | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Ease of use | Very beginner-friendly | Not ideal for advanced workflows | Drag-and-drop interface is approachable for new users
| Data handling | Great for small/medium data | Struggles with big datasets | May require batching or server-side processing for large data
| Automation | Visual workflows are powerful | Poor scripting and automation support | Hard to build repeatable, CI-friendly pipelines
| Extensibility / Add-ons | Extensible with add-ons | Smaller ecosystem, occasional bugs | Some community packages exist but ecosystem is thinner than mainstream ML libs

## Proposed Data Flow (high-level)

1. User input → server (experiment configuration, dataset upload, parameter adjustments)
2. Server → backend (Python processes perform training, evaluation, simulation)
3. Backend → server (streaming training state, metrics, model snapshots)
4. Server → frontend (real-time visualizations, controls, collaboration events)

This flow supports live streaming updates and multi-user dashboards.

---

## Prioritized Feature List (initial MVP suggestions)

1. Core interactive visualizer for a few classic algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, small neural nets).
2. Live training stream with basic parameter sliders (learning rate, batch size).
3. Algorithmic storytelling annotations that explain model behavior in plain language.
4. Simple multi-user dashboard with shared views and comments.
5. Import/export integration with Orange workflows (where feasible) and common data formats (CSV, Parquet).

---

## Risks & Considerations

- Performance: real-time streaming for large models can be resource heavy; ensure scalable back-end or sampling strategies.
- Privacy / data security: multi-user dashboards need access controls and careful data handling.
- Complexity vs. clarity: adding more visuals risks overwhelming beginner users — provide progressive disclosure and presets.

---

## Next Steps

- Validate user problems by interviewing potential users (novice ML learners, data scientists who use Orange).
- Build a small prototype demonstrating real-time training visualization for a toy model on a small dataset.
- Test multi-user synchronization using a simple WebSocket-backed demo.
- Iterate on storytelling UI elements based on user feedback.

## Raw Notes (verbatim capture from original doc)

- Visualizer for Machine Learning Algorithms (Better version of orangedatamining)
- We fix what Orange lacks
- Low intuition 
	- (They show numbers (accuracy, loss) but not why the model behaves that way.
	- We can fix this by creating algorithmic storytelling visuals — patterns, rhythms, reasoning.
	- Static
	- Few offer live, streaming updates or parameter control sliders.

- Add real-time simulation of ML behavior as it trains or adapts
- Poor collaboration
	- Most are single-user tools.
	- Build multi-user, web-based dashboards for team learning or exploration.
